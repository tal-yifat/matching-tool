# matching-tool
This is a software tool that takes as input a database table with new historical records about people in Renaissance Florence (a "component table"), and recommends whether the record should be identified as an existing person in the database. There are about 60k existing people in the database, and the information about them is summarized in a "master table". The tool produces the results as a new table. This is the code for the proof of concept phase, which tested an initial prototype of the tool with a table of new records that had been manually identified. The tool compares the automatic recommendations to the manual ones.
